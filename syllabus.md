<a name="approach"></A>
##Our Approach##

*Open*  
We’ll be blogging about the class and posting audio recordings of some content online.

*Participatory*  
The last three weeks have been left unscheduled intentionally, as we hope to evolve this class in an open dialogue with you all. We expect you to voice preferences on the material and challenge what we’ve laid out.

<a name="components"></a>
##Class Components##

*Lectures*  
Lectures will be given in class for 15 - 45 minutes, followed by a question and answer session. The majority of the lectures will be given by outside speakers, and we encourage you to familiarize yourself with the speaker before s/he comes into class. We’ll audio-record all lectures and post the files to Soundcloud, but the Q&As will be off-the-record (no recording, no tweeting, no blogging, etc.)

*Story Time*  
Many weeks, we’ll invite an entrepreneur into the class to tell his or her stories and answer questions. The Q&A section of story time will be off-the-record.

*Writing*  
We’re asking you write at least 750 words, using[ 750words](http://750words.com/), five of the seven days each week of the semester. 750words is a default-private site that provides a text box and a word count. While we’ll be able to tell how much you wrote, and we’ll not be able to see what you wrote. Use this to write about your ideas, inspirations, experiences, and/or responses to the readings, lectures, or generally things that happen each day.

We also ask you to write and publish one blog post each week that expresses an opinion about something related to the class on your personal Tumblr or blog. We’ll reblog these posts to a class Tumblr. You’ll be added as a contributor to the class Tumblr; please use it for other photos, links, quotes, text, etc. that you’d like to share with the entire class.

*Love Letters*  
Love letters are stories told by founders. Some were written, while others were video recorded. We’ve found stories from entrepreneurs to be both humanizing and inspirational.

*Readings*  
We’re looking forward to discussing the readings with you. If it’s a rough week, please preference the readings denoted with *s.

*Show and Tell*  
Show and tell time is set aside each class for you to talk through your efforts to complete the assignments. We’re interested in hearing about what worked and what didn’t; what you accidentally got right and what you’d do differently. In order to share during show and tell, you’ll need to have at least attempted the assignments.

##Coursework##

*Assignments*  
There are 10 assignments.  They can be completed in any order.  Multiple assignments may be combined into a single effort.  You may work on assignments with people from outside the class so long as you are able to explain your work.

*Dating*  
Four times this semester, we’ll set you up on a "date," based on your background and interests, with someone you don’t know. After an email introduction, you’ll find a time and place for the meeting -- perhaps you could meet one another for coffee or lunch? We hope these meetings will give you experience “talking to strangers” about your interests. After each date, we’ll collect feedback from your partner, which we’ll pass on to you confidentially.

*Final Project*  
Create and deliver a product or service that generates $1,000 (approximately one month’s rent) of gross profit before the final class on April 25. You can teach [Skillshare](http://skillshare.com/) classes, start a [ Shapeways](http://shapeways.com/) or [Etsy](http://etsy.com/) store, launch a [Kickstarter](http://kickstarter.com/) project, or create something else entirely.  

*Grading*  
Grading will be based on the effort you put toward this class. Students who come to class prepared to discuss the love letters and readings, who engage with the lecturers and story tellers, and who approach the assignments thoughtfully will do well.
